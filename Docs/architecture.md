# Task Management App Architecture

## Tech Stack Selection

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
  - Server components for improved performance
  - Built-in API routes for backend functionality
  - Excellent TypeScript support
  - File-based routing
  - Built-in optimizations (image, fonts, etc.)

- **UI Components**: 
  - Shadcn/ui for base components
    - Based on Radix UI primitives
    - Highly customizable
    - Accessible by default
    - Easy to extend
  - Custom components built on top for specific needs

- **Styling**: 
  - Tailwind CSS
    - Utility-first approach
    - Easy responsive design
    - Built-in dark mode support
    - Minimal bundle size

- **State Management**: 
  - Zustand
    - Simple and lightweight
    - Great TypeScript support
    - Easy integration with React
    - Middleware support for persistence
  - React Query/SWR for server state
    - Automatic caching
    - Optimistic updates
    - Real-time synchronization

### Backend
- **API Layer**: Next.js API Routes
  - Collocated with frontend initially
  - Easy to extract to separate service later
  - TypeScript end-to-end type safety
  - Built-in middleware support

- **Database**: 
  - Prisma ORM
    - Type-safe database access
    - Auto-generated migrations
    - Great developer experience
    - Query optimization
  - SQLite for local development
    - Easy to set up
    - No external dependencies
    - Can be switched to PostgreSQL for production

### Testing Stack
- **Unit Testing**: Vitest
  - Fast execution
  - Great developer experience
  - Jest compatibility
  - Watch mode with UI

- **Component Testing**: 
  - React Testing Library
    - User-centric testing approach
    - Good practices enforcement
    - Accessibility testing

- **E2E Testing**: Playwright
  - Cross-browser testing
  - Reliable test execution
  - Great debugging tools
  - Visual testing capabilities

## Key Architecture Decisions

### 1. Domain-Driven Design (Light)
- Clear separation of concerns
- Rich domain models
- Business logic isolation in services
- Type-safe interfaces

### 2. Component Architecture
- Atomic design principles
- Composition over inheritance
- Clear component boundaries
- Reusable UI components

### 3. State Management Strategy
- Local state for UI components
- Zustand for global application state
- Server state with React Query/SWR
- Optimistic updates for better UX

### 4. API Design
- RESTful principles
- Type-safe endpoints
- Proper error handling
- Validation at all levels

### 5. Database Design
- Flexible schema for future extensions
- Proper indexing strategy
- Support for custom fields
- Efficient querying patterns

### 6. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for business logic
- Component tests for UI
- Integration tests for API
- E2E tests for critical flows

## Scalability Considerations
- Modular architecture for easy scaling
- Clear boundaries between features
- Easy to extract services
- Support for future enhancements

## Security Measures
- Input validation
- Type safety
- API route protection
- Data sanitization
- Proper error handling

## Performance Optimization
- Server components where beneficial
- Efficient state management
- Proper caching strategies
- Optimistic updates
- Image optimization
